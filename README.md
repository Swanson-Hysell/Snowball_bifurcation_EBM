# Snowball bifurcation energy-balance model

This repository hosts a notebook that implements the 0-D energy balance model of Pierrehumbert et al. (2011). It utilizes the Python script published by Pierrehumbert et al. (2011) which itself uses the ClimateUtilities modules. 

A run of the model with slightly modified variables is visualized in a simplified plot of just the upper and lower limb without showing the unstable branches. In addition, CO<sub>_2</sub> decrease scenarios are shown (2 CO<sub>_2</sub> halvings) starting at different initial global mean temperatures. These scenarios illustrate that the effect of a decrease in CO<sub>_2</sub> (say driven by changing paleogeographic boundary conditions) on Earth's climate state will be quite different depending on the initial starting condition.
