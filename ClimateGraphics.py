#----------Section 3: Plotting utilities-------------------------------
#These need to be localized, for systems that don't support Ngl
#
#This is imported into ClimateUtilities. If you want to use a
#different graphics package (e.g. MatPlotLib) as a graphics driver
#in place of Ngl, you only need to rewrite this module. The most
#important thing to rewrite is the plot(...) function, which takes
#a Curve object as input and produces a line plot.  The plot(...)
#function returns a plotObj object to allow further manipulation
#(mostly saving the plot in various formats), but if you have a plotting
#package that provides other ways of saving the plots, or if you just
#want to save the plots by doing screen dumps, you can just have
#the plot(...) function return None, or some dummy object.
#
#The other main function to customize is contour(...) which produces
#contour plots of an array. This function is not very extensively
#used in the courseware, so it is a lower priority for modification.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------


#Note: On some older installations, Ngl has to
#be imported as PyNGL instead of Ngl.  If there
#is a trouble with the import, fiddle with that.

#ToDo:
#       *Implement use of missing data coding.
#       *Provide some way to re-use window (e.g. by
#         returning w, and having it be an optional
#         argument. How to clear a window for re-use?
#       *Make some use of dashed lines in line styles
#       *The behavior of axis options like reverseX and
#        XlogAxis is confusing when switchXY = True. We
#        need to think about the semantics of what we
#        mean by the "X" axis, and stick to it.  As
#        currently implemented the "X" axis means the
#        horizontal axis for these options.  (However,
#        the semantics is different for the labeling options!)
#        If we change this (and we probably should), the
#        scripts plotting soundings will also need to be changed.
#        as well as the Workbook intructions and problem sets.
